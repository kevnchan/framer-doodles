# Framer Doodles
Inspired by the concept of DailyUI, Framer Doodles is a personal project for me to practice using the FramerJS CoffeeScript library. I will be taking UI prompts from [DailyUI](http://http://www.dailyui.co/) and either designing a UI myself, or taking a pre-existing design I like from Dribbble or another online source. Designs that are heavily inspired by others will be sited.
